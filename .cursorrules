# Project Cursor Rules (court-check-server)

#

# Goal: keep code minimal, explicit, and predictable.

## Code standards (strict)

- Make the **smallest possible change** to satisfy the request. Avoid refactors unless required.
- **Do not add fallbacks/defaults** (no silent defaults, no “just in case” branches). Prefer failing fast.
- **Do not add unnecessary try/catch**. Only catch when you can handle/recover meaningfully; otherwise let errors surface.
- Do not add speculative validation, logging, retries, or “future-proofing” unless asked.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose. Remove dead/unused code immediately.

## TypeScript / Node conventions

- Prefer explicit types at module boundaries; avoid `any` unless unavoidable.
- Prefer `const`; avoid mutable state unless necessary.
- Prefer `import`/ESM; keep module style consistent within a file.

## Operational conventions

- Prefer reading existing code before editing to match established patterns.
- Do not ask for confirmation before applying code changes.
